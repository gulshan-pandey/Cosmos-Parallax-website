        <h2 class="md-heading">The Observable Universe</h2>
        <p class="para">
            The observable universe is a vast expanse that includes all matter, energy, and phenomena that can be detected from Earth. It's filled with billions of galaxies, each containing millions to billions of stars, and a variety of celestial objects. The observable universe is estimated to be about 93 billion light years in diameter.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            It's important to note that the universe is expanding, and the rate of expansion—known as the Hubble constant—is a key issue in modern astronomy. This expansion has significant implications for our understanding of the cosmos and the future of the universe.

    <h2 class="md-heading">Planets</h2>
    <p class="para">
        Planets, those magnificent celestial bodies that dance in the vast expanse of the cosmos, are entities of awe-inspiring beauty and unfathomable mystery. They gracefully orbit their parent stars, tracing elliptical paths through the void, each a mesmerizing ballet of gravity and motion. With their nearly spherical shapes, planets stand as silent sentinels, guardians of their own realms in the cosmic dance.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        Within our own solar system, a tapestry woven from the fabric of space and time, lie eight such wonders: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each of these celestial marvels bears its own unique tapestry of characteristics, a symphony of elements and compositions that sets it apart from its brethren. Take, for instance, Earth, our cherished home, the cradle of life itself, its verdant landscapes and teeming ecosystems a testament to the miracle of existence. Or consider Jupiter, the behemoth of the solar system, its massive bulk dominating the cosmic stage, its swirling clouds and raging storms a testament to the awesome power of nature. Indeed, each planet, with its own story to tell, adds another chapter to the grand narrative of the universe.

    <h2 class="md-heading">Meteors</h2>
    <p class="para">
        Meteors, often referred to as shooting stars, are small particles from space that burn up as they enter Earth's atmosphere, creating a streak of light across the sky. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the Earth's surface. Intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which may produce greater than 1,000 meteors an hour.

    <h2 class="md-heading">Pulsars</h2>
    <p class="para">
        Pulsars are a type of neutron star; they're small, dense remnants of massive stars that have exploded as supernovae. Pulsars emit beams of radiation that sweep through Earth's line of sight. With masses greater than that of the Sun but a radius of about 10 kilometers, pulsars possess incredibly high densities. The powerful magnetic field and fast rotation of a pulsar accelerate charged particles to emit beams of electromagnetic radiation, usually radio waves.

    <h2 class="md-heading">Singularities</h2>
    <p class="para">
        Singularities refer to the core of a black hole, a point where the curvature of space-time is infinite and matter is believed to be infinitely dense. At the singularity, gravitational forces are extremely strong, and space-time curves towards infinity. While singularities are hidden within black holes and thus not observable directly, they play a key role in the study of general relativity and are a topic of ongoing research in theoretical physics.
